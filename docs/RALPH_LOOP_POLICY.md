# Ralph Loop Policy

Reference: https://github.com/snarktank/ralph

## Default
- Ralph Loop is **off** by default.

## When to propose
Only propose Ralph Loop when:
1. requirements are unstable,
2. iterative hypothesis-testing is needed,
3. quick feedback cycles reduce risk.

## Agent behavior
- Agent should ask user before enabling Ralph Loop.
- If enabled, log each loop iteration in markdown/json.
